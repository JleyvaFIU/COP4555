Homework #4

1. Modify the grammar to allow an exponential operator, ^, so that we can write expressions like i + i ^ i * i. Of course, your modified grammar should be unambiguous. Give exponentiation higher precedence than the other binary operators and (unlike the other binary operators) make it associate to the right. 

E -> E + T | E - T | T
T -> T * F | T / F | F
F -> X ^ F | X
X -> i | (E)

Solving for i + i ^ i + i:

				      E
             / \
            /   \ 
	         /	|	 \
		      E		+	  T
         /|\      |
		   /  |  \		|
	    E   +   T   F
      |       |		|
      T	      F	  X
	    |      /|\  |
      F     X ^ F i
      |     |   |
      X     i   X
      |         |
      i         i
